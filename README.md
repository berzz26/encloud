## Features

- Detects `.env*` files in your workspace
- Password-based encryption (PBKDF2 + AES-256-CBC)
- GitHub authentication for user management
- Secure cloud storage with end-to-end encryption
- Restore `.env` files on any device with your password

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation

1. Open VS Code
2. Go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X / Cmd+Shift+X)
3. Search for "Encloud"
4. Click Install

### First-time Setup

1. Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P / Cmd+Shift+P)
2. Type "Encloud: Login" and press Enter
3. Authenticate with your GitHub account
4. Create your encryption password (minimum 8 characters)
   - **Important**: This password is used to encrypt your data and cannot be recovered if lost

### Basic Usage

1. **Syncing .env Files**:

   - Open the Command Palette
   - Run "Encloud: Sync .env Files"
   - Select files to encrypt and sync

2. **Restoring .env Files**:

   - Open the Command Palette
   - Run "Encloud: Restore .env Files"
   - Enter your password to decrypt files

3. **Clearing Stored Data**:
   - Open the Command Palette
   - Run "Encloud: Clear .env Data"
   - Confirm to remove all stored .env files

## üîí Security

- Password-based key derivation (PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations)
- AES-256-CBC encryption for file contents
- Only salt and verification hash stored in database
- Zero-knowledge design - server never sees your password or decrypted data
- Each operation requires password verification

## üõ†Ô∏è For Developers

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- VS Code
- Supabase account (for backend)

### Local Development Setup

This project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as its package manager for faster and more efficient dependency management.

1. Install pnpm if you haven't already:

   ```bash
   npm install -g pnpm
   ```

2. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/berzz26/encloud.git
   cd encloud
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file with your Supabase credentials:

   ```
   SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   ```

5. Run the extension in development mode:
   - Press F5 in VS Code to start debugging
   - A new VS Code window will open with the extension loaded

### Building the Extension

```bash
pnpm run build   # Compile TypeScript code
pnpm run package # Create VSIX package
```

This will create a `.vsix` file that can be installed manually in VS Code.

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Login Fails**

   - Ensure you have a stable internet connection
   - Check if GitHub authentication services are operational
   - Try clearing browser cookies and cache

2. **Cannot Sync Files**

   - Verify that your workspace contains `.env` files
   - Ensure you're logged in (run "Encloud: Login" first)
   - Check if you have write permissions to the workspace

3. **Password Not Working**

   - Passwords are case-sensitive
   - Ensure you're using the same password that was set during initial setup
   - There is no password recovery - if lost, you'll need to clear data and start fresh

4. **Files Not Restoring**
   - Verify that you've previously synced files
   - Check if you're using the correct password
   - Ensure you have write permissions to the workspace

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- Keep your password safe - there's no recovery mechanism
- Password required for both sync and restore operations
- Works across different devices with the same password
- Always backup important .env files before using this extension
